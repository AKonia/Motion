Motion was created by Zachariah Brown (zsbzsb). Motion is written
in C++ with duel C style functions so that it can be utilized by
C++ or CLR/CLI programs. It provides an easy way to add video or
audio playback to any SFML program. FFMPEG is used for decoding
the files and then is played back using SFML.
