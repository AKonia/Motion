Motion -- This software is provided 'as-is' without any express or

Motion was created by Zachariah Brown (zsbzsb). Motion is written
in C++ with duel C style functions so that it can be utilized by
C++ or CLR/CLI programs. It provides an easy way to add video or
audio playback to any SFML program. FFMPEG is used for decoding
the files and then the data played back using SFML.

Check the included example folders for a quick code example to get
up and running. Remember MotionNET depends on Motion while the
Motion project can be used independently of MotionNET.
